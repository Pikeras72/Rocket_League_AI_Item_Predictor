# Rocket League - AI Item Predictor
**Image classifier** of items from the video game '*Rocket League*'. 

\* The project is currently on hold until I have enough knowledge to proceed with the **multi-labeling classification** :) \*

*First job with Artificial Intelligence.*

### 1. Description
This is a project to try to identify the type of different `Rocket League` items via images. I created a dataset collected, modified and cleaned from [rlgarage](https://rocket-league.com/items).
All the images were *220x220*px and `.png` format.

The images were separated into different directories according to the type they corresponded to. The training and validation directories were also added with `1584 images belonging to training` and `395 images belonging to validation`.

I had to remove the "explosions" element type, since it would create a big problem for the model when it comes to differentiating between "boosts" and "explosions", since in the images they were practically impossible to classify even for a person with knowledge about the game.

This is my first project related to `AI`, with `CNN` and `image classification` and if possible I would like to improve the scope of this project to deploy the model in a real environment when it is finished and is able to classify several items in a single photo.

### 2. Visuals

For example, given this image:

The model predicted this:

```

### 3. Versioning
 #### Update [26/08/2023]

**Version 0.1.1** is out! This version includes the following:

- `RL_items` dataset available to download and use inside the notebook.
- `86% accuracy example model` added for easier understanding of the project.
-  Image augmentation included to try to improve the model's accuracy.
-  Allows users to build their own model from a prebuilt example.

Weak points:

- `86% accuracy example model` should be modified or redone to improve it's accuracy.
- `Model predictions` should be easier to understand for the final user, instead of showing the results with numbers.
  
Future Improvements:

- `Save & Download your model` feature should be added.
- `Model predictions` should be easier to understand for the final user, instead of showing the results with numbers.
-  Finish the 'Conclusions' section in the notebook.
  
#### Update [27/08/2023]

Few changes added!

- `96% accuracy example model` in order to substitute the old example model.
-  Image augmentation was removed as the main objective of the project is to identify the type of the object from a specific type of image, allowing the model to improve it's accuracy by `10%`.
-  `Save & Download your model` feature was added. Now you can continue working with your own creation!
-  `Model predictions` are now shown as the type of object that was predicted instead of a bunch of numbers.

 Weak points:

- The model struggle to differenciate sometimes images between `boosts & trails`.
- There is no `Table of Contents` in the notebook.
  
Future Improvements:

- Add the version of the project to the notebook.
- Maybe I could improve the explanations of each block inside the notebook for the reader to understand it better.
- This is was the first milestone in the project, now I can start studying the possibilities to expand the model or create a new one to classify various items in the same image.
- Finish the 'Conclusions' section in the notebook.

### 4. Technologies

`tensorflow` and `tensorflow.keras` for the model training and the model structure.

`matplotlib.pyplot`, `numpy` and `PIL.Image` for showing the results of the training and some examples of the dataset.

`gdown` and `google.colab` to load/download the model into your PC once it has been saved.
